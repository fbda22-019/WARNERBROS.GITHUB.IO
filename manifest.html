			In this character-driven mystery-drama from executive producers Jeff Rake, 
		  Robert Zemeckis and Jack Rapke, a commercial plane inexplicably disappears on a 
		  trans-oceanic flight and, more mysteriously, returns five years later after being
		  presumed lost at sea. While no time has passed for those on the flight, years have 
		  gone by for their loved ones at home who have learned to live with their loss. Both 
		  a high-concept event mystery and a relationship drama about interrupted lives, MANIFEST
		  centers on the supernaturally fractured Stone family: On the flight are Michaela, a
		  guilt-ridden police officer considering her engagement; her brother, Ben, a Type-A 
		  father struggling with what he can't control; and Cal, Ben's terminally ill 10-year-old
		  son with months to live. Landing five years later (but only five hours later for the 
		  travelers), they're reunited with Jared Vasquez, Michaela's onetime fiancé, now a married
		  detective; Grace Stone, Ben's wife tentatively embracing the miracle of her family's return;
		  and Olive, Cal's twin sister who's now five years older, but still shares a bond with him. As
		  the story unfolds through the lens of these and other passengers and flight crew wrestling with
		  their interrupted lives and relationships, the government continues to investigate how and why 
		  this anomaly happened. But in addition to the outward mystery of what happened on that flight, 
		  there's also an inward mystery of what has happened to the passengers…and why. A spiritual drama
		  about broken souls trying to repair themselves and the world around them, the series follows their 
		  intersecting personal lives, their connections, as well as the overarching mystery, and the ultimate 
		  purpose that is their destiny.
